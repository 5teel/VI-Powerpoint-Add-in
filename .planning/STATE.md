## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All phases: No chart API in Office.js — all charts are canvas-to-image (Chart.js → ShapeFill.setImage)
- Phase 1: CORS validation is day-one gate — if Cube AI blocks WebView2 origin, a proxy server must be scoped before Phase 3
- Phase 4: Cube AI response format must be observed empirically before finalizing SlideLayout schema parser
- Phase 5: ShapeFill.setImage() is GA primary path; addPicture() is Preview enhancement only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: CORS behavior for ai.gcp-us-central1.cubecloud.dev from WebView2 origin is unverified — proxy server may be required
- Phase 4: Cube AI prompt engineering for structured JSON output will require empirical tuning (1-2 days estimated)
- General: Target users must be on Microsoft 365 subscription builds (PowerPointApi 1.8 requirement excludes LTSC/volume-licensed Office)
